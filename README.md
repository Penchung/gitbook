# Hello Gitbook

An example 

# H1
## H2
### H3
#### H4

* If you want your words to become italics *asterisks* or _underscores_.
* If you want your words to become bold **asterisks** or __underscores__.
* Combine both **asterisks and _underscores_**.
* If you want to cross out your words ~~two tildes~~

## List
Adding the plus, munius, or asterisks sign will generate an unordered list
- Item 1
* Item 2
+ Item 3

Adding numbers in front of your list will generate an ordered list
1. First ordered list item
2. Another item
3. Third item

If you have a sub-list, remember to leave a blank in front of your items, as in the below example:

1. This is a new list
 * one
 * two
2. Try to type one yourself
3. A cool list

## Table
Example code:

| Fruits | Are | Cool |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------|
| apple | 1000 | $1600 |
| orange | 2344 | $12 |
| banana | 2 | $1 |
